README: Sprint Reflection
1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To understand user needs, I focus on clear communication with stakeholders to ensure I know what they’re asking for. Breaking these needs into user stories makes it easier to tackle the work in smaller, focused pieces. Each story helps the team stay on track and ensures the program aligns with what the user wants. For example, creating a user story for filtering vacation destinations by price and type helped make sure that feature met client expectations.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing programs, I like to take things one step at a time. Using Agile processes like Sprint Planning and Daily Stand-Ups keeps the team focused and allows us to adjust if something changes. I plan to keep using tools like task boards and apply techniques like pair programming to help improve teamwork and deliver better results.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating openly, staying accountable, and supporting others when they need help. Agile practices like Daily Stand-Ups make it easy to share progress and talk through any roadblocks. In this project, staying involved in these conversations and helping where I could made it easier for the team to succeed.
